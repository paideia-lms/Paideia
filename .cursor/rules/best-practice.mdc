## package manager
always use bun as package manager.

## frontend

Should use mantine component all the time. we should use design token from mantine. 

We should not use tailwind classes. Strictly prohibited.

We should not use any external css framework. Strictly prohibited.

when working with jsx array, we should not use index as key. we should use the id of the item if available.

we should use `<meta>` in the page component.

use `matches` to from Route.ComponentProps to check current route.

don't use `useEffect`, use `useEffectEvent` instead.

in loader and actions, we need to use `overrideAccess` to false and provide the current user ( `effectiveUser ?? authenticatedUser`) to the function.

we don't check for access in loader and actions. we only check for access in internal functions and through access hook in collections. 

we only use mantine form uncontrolled mode for all forms. never use `cascadeUpdates` for mantine form.

### styling

we should not hardcode `bg` color in mantine components unless it's absolutely necessary. we should provide comment to explain.

## contexts 

react router context should **not** import types from payload types. It should create types for itself to provide type stability for the frontend.

## testing 

every features on the backend should be tested using `bun:test`.

we should only use payload local api. we should not use anything related to nextjs.

testing should be simple and easy to read. for complex test, we better just skip and and test manually instead.

each test files should only have one describe block. each test file related to database, s3, redis or payload should have do a refresh using beforeAll. 

if you really want a completely isolated test, you should always create a new root describe block and its own beforeAll and AfterAll

## error handling

we **should not** use try catch, especially not in internal functions which we use typescript result, it will be confusing and hard to manage. we should use typescript result to handle the error, using `Result.wrap`. When a function return a result, function should be named with `try` prefix like `tryFunction` or `trySomething`.

in the loader of react router, we should throw ErrorResponse rather than just error. 

when throwing error using typescript result, we should first create the error in `app/utils/error.ts` first. The error class should be used in the `transformError` in `Result.wrap` or `Result.try`.

## permissions and access control

all permissions should be check in the server loader rather than in the component. we should use `PermissionResult` from `server/utils/permissions.ts` to check the permission.

## Database 

when an operation is doing multiple mutation to the database, we should **always** use transaction.

database migration should always be non breaking and backward compatible.

payload local api return document with unknown depth. we should handle both case when depth is 0 and 1, value is either object or id (string). 

**strictly avoid** using `as` operator in internal functions. **No type casting allowed**.

use virtual field over depth. we would rather have a nested virtual field than have depth more than 2, because depth can cause infinite loop.

all globals collections should be defined in a single `server/collections/globals.ts`.

## internal functions 

when user id provided to the internal function, we can always assume the user exists.

we should not expose the depth variable to args for internal functions. The output type should be defined.


## Changelog

changelog should be written in the `changelogs` folder. each changelog should be named like `0001-2025-01-01-feature-or-change-name.md`. the number should be the order of the changelog. the date should be the date of the changelog. the feature name should be the name of the feature. a standard changelog should look like this `changelogs/0016-2025-10-29-assignment-grading-page.md`.

## Release note

release note should be written in the `release-notes` folder. each release note should be named like `0.5.4-2025-11-08.md`. the date should be the date of the release note. the version should be the version of the release note. Release note aggregate all changelogs related to the release but be less specific and technical than changelog. should focus more on the features and the user impact, especially in term on user interface and user experience.

## Coding style

max line leng per file should be 1000. When exceeding, we should split the code into multiple files for readability.

for complicated code, we should always add comment to explain the code.

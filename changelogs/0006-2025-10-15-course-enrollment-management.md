# Course Enrollment Management System

**Date:** 2025-10-15  
**Type:** Feature  
**Scope:** Course Management, User Management  

## Overview

Added comprehensive enrollment management functionality to the course view page, allowing administrators to view, create, edit, and delete course enrollments with full pagination support.

## Changes Made

### Frontend Changes

#### Course View Page (`app/routes/course-view.$id.tsx`)

**New Features:**
- Added enrollment table displaying user details, roles, and status
- Implemented pagination for enrollment list (10 enrollments per page)
- Added "Enrol User" button for administrators
- Created modal dialogs for enrollment management

**Table Columns:**
- User name with avatar (first/last name initials)
- Username (derived from email)
- Email address
- Role badge (Student, Teacher, Teaching Assistant, Manager)
- Status badge (Active, Inactive, Completed, Dropped)
- Last access indicator (currently shows "Never")
- Action buttons (Edit/Delete) for administrators

**Modal Dialogs:**
- **Enroll User Modal:** Select user, role, and status for new enrollments
- **Edit Enrollment Modal:** Modify role and status of existing enrollments
- **Delete Confirmation Modal:** Confirm enrollment deletion with warning

**UI/UX Improvements:**
- Color-coded badges for roles and statuses
- Responsive table with horizontal scrolling
- Loading states during form submissions
- Success/error notifications for all actions
- Filtered user list (excludes already enrolled users)

### Backend Integration

**New Action Handlers:**
- `enroll` - Create new enrollment with user, role, and status
- `edit-enrollment` - Update existing enrollment role and status
- `delete-enrollment` - Remove enrollment from course

**Data Fetching:**
- Added enrollment pagination support using `trySearchEnrollments`
- Integrated user list fetching with `tryFindAllUsers`
- Proper error handling and transaction management

### Access Control

**Permission Requirements:**
- Only administrators can enroll users
- Only administrators can edit/delete enrollments
- All users with course access can view enrollment list
- Non-admin users see read-only enrollment table

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
- Modal state using `useDisclosure` hooks
- Form state for user selection, role, and status
- Pagination state using URL search parameters
- Loading states for form submissions

### Data Flow
- Server-side pagination with URL parameter synchronization
- Real-time form validation and submission
- Optimistic UI updates with error rollback
- Proper cleanup of form state after actions

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error messages for all failure scenarios
- Transaction rollback on enrollment creation failures
- User-friendly error notifications
- Graceful handling of missing or invalid data

## Database Impact

**No Schema Changes Required:**
- Utilizes existing `enrollments` collection
- Leverages existing user and course relationships
- Maintains referential integrity through Payload CMS

**Performance Considerations:**
- Pagination limits database load (10 enrollments per page)
- Efficient user filtering to prevent duplicate enrollments
- Optimized queries with proper depth handling

## User Experience

### Administrator Workflow
1. Navigate to course view page
2. View enrollment table with pagination
3. Click "Enrol User" to add new enrollments
4. Use edit/delete actions to manage existing enrollments
5. Receive immediate feedback on all actions

### Visual Design
- Consistent with existing Mantine design system
- Color-coded status indicators for quick recognition
- Intuitive modal workflows
- Responsive design for all screen sizes

## Future Enhancements

**Potential Improvements:**
- Bulk enrollment operations
- Advanced filtering and search
- Export enrollment data
- Integration with user groups
- Last access tracking implementation
- Email notifications for enrollment changes

## Testing Considerations

**Manual Testing Required:**
- Enrollment creation with various role/status combinations
- Pagination navigation and URL state persistence
- Error handling for duplicate enrollments
- Permission verification for non-admin users
- Modal state management and form validation

**Edge Cases:**
- Empty enrollment lists
- Single page enrollment lists (pagination hidden)
- Form submission during loading states
- Network error handling

## Migration Notes

**No Migration Required:**
- Feature is additive and doesn't modify existing data
- Backward compatible with existing enrollment data
- No breaking changes to existing APIs

## Security Considerations

**Access Control:**
- Server-side permission validation for all enrollment actions
- Proper user authentication checks
- Transaction-based data integrity
- Input validation and sanitization

**Data Protection:**
- No sensitive data exposure in client-side code
- Proper error message sanitization
- Secure form submission handling

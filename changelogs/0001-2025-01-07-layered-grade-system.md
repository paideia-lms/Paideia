# Changelog 0001 - Layered Grade System Implementation

**Date:** 2025-10-07  
**Type:** Major Feature  
**Status:** Completed

## Summary

Implemented a comprehensive layered grade system to eliminate data duplication and provide flexible grading capabilities with bonus points, penalties, and overrides while maintaining data integrity.

## Changes Made

### Database Schema Changes

#### 1. Updated UserGrades Collection
- **Removed:** Simple `grade` field
- **Added:** Layered grade system with:
  - `baseGrade`: Original grade from submission or manual entry
  - `baseGradeSource`: Tracks whether grade came from submission or manual entry
  - `submission`: Optional reference to submission (assignment/quiz/discussion)
  - `submissionType`: Type of submission (assignment/quiz/discussion/manual)
  - `adjustments`: Array of grade adjustments (bonus, penalty, late deduction, etc.)
  - `isOverridden`: Boolean flag for grade overrides
  - `overrideGrade`: Override value when grade is manually overridden
  - `overrideReason`: Reason for override
  - `overriddenBy`: User who applied the override
  - `overriddenAt`: Timestamp of override
  - `status`: Grade status (draft/graded/returned)

#### 2. Removed Grade Fields from Submission Collections
- **AssignmentSubmissions:** Removed `grade`, `maxGrade`, `feedback`, `gradedBy`, `gradedAt`
- **QuizSubmissions:** Removed `grade`, `feedback`, `gradedBy`, `gradedAt`
- **DiscussionSubmissions:** Removed `grade`, `maxGrade`, `feedback`, `gradedBy`, `gradedAt`
- **Kept:** Submission-specific fields like `content`, `attachments`, `answers`, `status`, `submittedAt`

#### 3. Added Grade Table System
- **SystemGradeTable (Global):** System-wide default grade letters (A+ to F)
- **CourseGradeTables (Collection):** Course-specific grade tables that override system defaults
- **Courses Collection:** Added `gradeTable` field to reference course-specific grade tables

### Code Changes

#### 1. Updated User Grade Management (`server/internal/user-grade-management.ts`)
- **Interfaces:** Updated `CreateUserGradeArgs`, `UpdateUserGradeArgs`, `BulkGradeUpdateArgs`
- **Functions:** Modified all grade management functions to work with layered system
- **Grade Calculation:** Enhanced final grade calculation to handle:
  - Base grade + active adjustments
  - Override grades when `isOverridden` is true
  - Proper validation and error handling

#### 2. Updated Tests (`server/internal/user-grade-management.test.ts`)
- **Test Cases:** Updated all test cases to use `baseGrade` instead of `grade`
- **Validation:** Updated grade validation tests for new structure
- **Bulk Operations:** Updated bulk grade update tests

### Key Features

#### 1. Layered Grade Calculation
```typescript
// Final Grade = Base Grade + Active Adjustments (or Override if set)
let finalGrade = baseGrade || 0;

// Add active adjustments
if (adjustments && adjustments.length > 0) {
  const activeAdjustments = adjustments
    .filter(adj => adj.isActive)
    .reduce((sum, adj) => sum + adj.points, 0);
  finalGrade += activeAdjustments;
}

// Use override if set
if (isOverridden && overrideGrade !== null) {
  finalGrade = overrideGrade;
}
```

#### 2. Grade Adjustments System
- **Types:** Bonus, Penalty, Late Deduction, Participation, Curve, Other
- **Tracking:** Each adjustment includes reason, applied by, timestamp, and active status
- **Flexibility:** Adjustments can be toggled on/off without losing history

#### 3. Override System
- **Preserves Original:** Base grade and adjustments remain intact when overridden
- **Audit Trail:** Tracks who overrode, when, and why
- **Reversible:** Overrides can be removed to restore calculated grade

#### 4. Single Source of Truth
- **UserGrades Collection:** All grading data stored in one place
- **No Duplication:** Eliminates conflicting grade data across collections
- **Consistency:** Impossible to have mismatched grades between submissions and gradebook

## Benefits

1. **Data Integrity:** Single source of truth eliminates grade duplication and inconsistency
2. **Flexibility:** Supports various grading scenarios (bonus points, penalties, overrides)
3. **Transparency:** Complete audit trail of all grade changes and adjustments
4. **Maintainability:** Cleaner codebase with centralized grade management
5. **Scalability:** Easy to add new adjustment types or grading features

## Migration Notes

- **Breaking Change:** All existing grade references need to be updated to use `baseGrade`
- **Data Migration:** Existing grades will need to be migrated to the new structure
- **API Changes:** Grade management functions now use different parameter names

## Future Enhancements

- Grade letter calculation from grade tables
- Automated grade calculation from submission scores
- Grade history and audit logging (using Payload's built-in features)
- Grade analytics and reporting
- Integration with external grading systems

## Files Modified

- `server/payload.config.ts` - Updated collections and added grade tables
- `server/internal/user-grade-management.ts` - Updated grade management functions
- `server/internal/user-grade-management.test.ts` - Updated test cases
- `src/migrations/20251007_162715.ts` - Database migration for new schema

## Testing

- All existing tests updated and passing
- New test cases for layered grade system
- Validation tests for grade adjustments and overrides
- Bulk operations testing with new structure

# Changelog 0022: Gradebook Structure Building Refactor

**Date**: October 30, 2025

## Overview

Refactored gradebook structure building logic by extracting recursive category structure construction into a dedicated, testable module. This improves code maintainability, testability, and separation of concerns while preserving existing functionality. The refactor ensures proper handling of root-level items and nested categories without duplication.

## Features

### 1. Extracted Gradebook Structure Builder Module

Created a new dedicated module `server/internal/build-gradebook-structure.ts` that handles recursive category structure building:

- **Core function**: `buildCategoryStructure()` recursively constructs gradebook category hierarchies
- **Type definitions**: `CategoryData` and `ItemData` interfaces for type-safe data handling
- **Root-level handling**: Properly separates root-level items from category items to prevent duplication
- **Nested support**: Handles deeply nested category structures with items at any level
- **Clear separation**: Items are processed before categories at the same level for consistent ordering

**Key Logic**:
- When `categoryId === null`: Only processes root categories (not root items, which are handled separately)
- When `categoryId` is a number: Processes both items and subcategories for that category
- Items are always processed before categories at the same level

### 2. Comprehensive Test Coverage

Added test suite `server/internal/build-gradebook-structure.test.ts` with three critical test cases:

- **Root item duplication prevention**: Ensures root-level items are not included when processing root categories
- **Category item inclusion**: Verifies items are correctly included when processing specific categories
- **Nested category handling**: Tests recursive building of deeply nested category structures

### 3. Refactored Gradebook Management

Updated `server/internal/gradebook-management.ts` to use the extracted module:

- **Import**: Uses `buildCategoryStructure` from the new module
- **Type imports**: Imports `CategoryData` and `ItemData` types for type safety
- **Simplified logic**: Removed inline category building logic, replaced with function call
- **Consistent behavior**: Maintains existing gradebook JSON representation functionality

### 4. Enhanced Course Context Integration

Updated `server/contexts/course-context.ts` to leverage the refactored structure:

- **Gradebook setup**: Uses the new structure building for `gradebookSetupForUI`
- **Category flattening**: Enhanced `flattenGradebookCategories()` to work with the new structure
- **Type safety**: Properly typed with `GradebookSetupItemWithCalculations`

### 5. Route Params Integration

Enhanced global context and middleware to support route parameters:

- **PageInfo enhancement**: Added `params: Record<string, string>` to `PageInfo` type in `server/contexts/global-context.ts`
- **Middleware update**: Updated `server/index.ts` to initialize params in default pageInfo
- **Route awareness**: Enables type-safe route parameter access throughout the application

### 6. Grades Page Updates

Updated `app/routes/course.$id.grades.tsx` to work with the refactored structure:

- **Loader**: Uses gradebook data from course context (now built with new structure)
- **Display**: Gradebook setup view properly renders nested categories and items
- **Modals**: Category and item creation modals work with flattened category structure

## Technical Implementation

### New Files

#### `server/internal/build-gradebook-structure.ts`

Core module containing:
- `CategoryData` interface: Type for category data from Payload queries
- `ItemData` interface: Type for item data from Payload queries
- `buildCategoryStructure()` function: Recursive function that builds category hierarchies

**Function Signature**:
```typescript
export function buildCategoryStructure(
    categoryId: number | null,
    categories: CategoryData[],
    items: ItemData[],
): GradebookSetupItem[]
```

**Key Implementation Details**:
- Filters categories by parent ID
- When `categoryId !== null`, processes items for that category first
- Recursively processes subcategories
- Returns array of `GradebookSetupItem` objects with proper nesting

#### `server/internal/build-gradebook-structure.test.ts`

Test suite with three comprehensive tests:
1. Verifies root items are not duplicated when processing root categories
2. Ensures items are included when processing specific categories
3. Tests nested category structure building

### Modified Files

#### `server/internal/gradebook-management.ts`

**Changes**:
- Imports `buildCategoryStructure` from new module
- Imports `CategoryData` and `ItemData` types
- Replaces inline category building with `buildCategoryStructure()` call
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing `tryGetGradebookJsonRepresentation()` function

**Key Updates**:
- Lines 14-15: Added imports for new module and types
- Lines 686-708: Uses `buildCategoryStructure()` instead of inline logic
- Properly handles root items separately before calling `buildCategoryStructure(null, ...)`

#### `server/contexts/course-context.ts`

**Changes**:
- Uses gradebook setup data that leverages the new structure building
- Enhanced category flattening function works with nested structures
- Proper type handling for `GradebookSetupItemWithCalculations`

#### `server/contexts/global-context.ts`

**Changes**:
- Added `params: Record<string, string>` to `PageInfo` type (line 71)
- Enables route parameter access in all components via `pageInfo.params`

#### `server/index.ts`

**Changes**:
- Initializes `params: {}` in default pageInfo object (line 87+)
- Provides empty params object for routes without parameters

#### `app/routes/course.$id.grades.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Loader uses gradebook data from course context
- Display components work with refactored structure
- Category options built from flattened categories

#### `server/internal/gradebook-category-management.test.ts`

**Changes**:
- Tests updated to work with refactored structure
- May include refresh logic updates

#### `app/routes/login.tsx`, `app/routes/registration.tsx`, `app/routes/admin/system.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Minor updates potentially related to route params or pageInfo usage
- Likely utilizing new `params` field in pageInfo

## Usage Examples

### Building Category Structure

```typescript
import { buildCategoryStructure } from "./build-gradebook-structure";

// Build root categories (root items handled separately)
const rootStructures = buildCategoryStructure(null, categories, items);

// Build structure for a specific category
const categoryStructures = buildCategoryStructure(categoryId, categories, items);
```

### Accessing Route Params

```typescript
// In any component with access to pageInfo
const { id } = pageInfo.params as RouteParams<"layouts/course-layout">;
// id is properly typed as string
```

## Benefits

1. **Improved Maintainability**: Separated concerns make code easier to understand and modify
2. **Better Testability**: Isolated function can be tested independently with comprehensive test coverage
3. **Type Safety**: Clear type definitions prevent errors and improve IDE support
4. **Bug Prevention**: Tests catch edge cases like root item duplication
5. **Code Reusability**: Extracted function can be reused in other contexts if needed
6. **Consistent Behavior**: Centralized logic ensures consistent gradebook structure building
7. **Route Awareness**: Route params available throughout application for better navigation

## Breaking Changes

None. All changes are internal refactoring that maintains backward compatibility with existing APIs and functionality.

## Migration Guide

No migration required. The refactor is transparent to users and existing code. All existing gradebook functionality continues to work as before.

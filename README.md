# 🌿 Paideia LMS

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> This project is in active development and is not yet ready for production use.

> [!NOTE] 
> We're actively looking for **contributors** and **sponsors** to help build and maintain Paideia LMS. Whether you're a developer, educator, or organization interested in supporting open-source education technology, we'd love to hear from you.

A modern, lightweight Learning Management System (LMS) built with [Bun](https://bun.sh) and [React Router v7](https://reactrouter.com/). Designed for extreme ease of management and deployment as a single executable.

## 🎯 Vision

Paideia LMS aims to be the modern alternative to traditional LMS platforms like Moodle. Built from the ground up with modern web technologies, it focuses on simplicity, performance, and developer experience while maintaining powerful LMS capabilities.

### Core Features

- **📚 Course Management**: Create and manage courses with assignments, quizzes, content, and grading
- **👥 User Management**: Comprehensive user creation and role-based access control
- **🔐 Access Control**: Fine-grained permissions and security
- **💳 Payment Integration**: Built-in payment processing capabilities
- **📊 Telemetry & Observability**: Advanced monitoring and analytics
- **🔄 Version Control**: Track changes and maintain course history
- **🔌 API**: RESTful API for integrations and extensions
- **📦 Single Executable**: Extremely easy deployment and management
- **🔄 LMS Import**: Import courses and data from Moodle, Canvas, and other LMS platforms
- **🔗 Integrations**: Connect with external tools and services

### Architecture Principles

- **🚀 Single Executable**: Package and deploy as one binary for maximum portability
- **🐰 Lightweight**: Minimal resource usage with fast startup times
- **🛡️ No Dynamic Plugins**: Built-in functionality without complex plugin management
- **🏢 Organization-Hosted**: Designed for server-based deployments, not serverless
- **⚡ Modern Stack**: Bun runtime + React Router v7 + TypeScript

## 💝 Free and Non-Profit

Paideia LMS will remain **free and non-profit forever** to benefit all organizations, educational institutions, and communities worldwide. We welcome sponsors and donations to support ongoing development and maintenance.

## Development

### App Only Development

Run just the development server (requires external database and MinIO):


```sh
bun dev
```

This starts:
- **PostgreSQL**: localhost:5432 (paideia/paideia_password)
- **MinIO**: http://localhost:9000 (API) / http://localhost:9001 (Web UI)
  - Access Key: paideia_minio
  - Secret Key: paideia_minio_secret
- **Drizzle Gateway**: localhost:4983
  - Master Password: your_master_password
  - Database URL: postgresql://paideia:paideia_password@postgres:5432/paideia_db
- **App**: http://localhost:3000

## Production

Build for production:

```sh
bun run build
```

Run in production mode:

```sh
bun start
```

### Docker

#### Building the Linux Binary

The Linux binary must be built in a Linux environment to ensure native dependencies (like `sharp`) are correctly compiled for Linux ARM64. You can use `Dockerfile.build` to create a build environment:

**Option 1: Using Docker Build Environment (Interactive)**

The `Dockerfile.build` creates an interactive build container where you can manually build the Linux binary:

1. **Create and start the build container:**

```sh
bun run docker:build-binary
```

This will:
- Build the Docker image with all dependencies
- Start a container named `paideia-builder`
- Print instructions for entering the container

2. **Enter the container:**

```sh
bun run docker:builder-shell
```

Or manually:
```sh
docker exec -it paideia-builder /bin/bash
```

3. **Build the Linux binary inside the container:**

```sh
bun scripts/build-linux.ts
```

4. **Copy the binary from the container:**

```sh
bun run docker:copy-binary
```

Or manually:
```sh
mkdir -p dist
docker cp paideia-builder:/build/dist/paideia-linux-arm64 ./dist/
```

**Option 2: Using build-linux.ts in a Linux Environment**

If you have access to a Linux machine or Linux container:

```sh
bun run build:linux
```

**Note:** Building the Linux binary on macOS won't work correctly because native dependencies like `sharp` will bundle the macOS version, which won't run on Linux. Always build the Linux binary in a Linux environment.

#### Building the Runtime Docker Image

Once you have the Linux binary in `dist/paideia-linux-arm64`, build the runtime Docker image:

```sh
docker build -t paideia:latest .
```

The runtime image is minimal and only contains the pre-built binary, making it perfect for deployment and GitHub releases.

Run the container with environment variables from a `.env` file:

```sh
docker run -d \
  --name paideia \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -p 3001:3001 \
  --env-file .env \
  paideia:latest
```

Alternatively, you can pass environment variables directly:

```sh
docker run -d \
  --name paideia \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -p 3001:3001 \
  -e DATABASE_URL=postgresql://paideia:paideia_password@postgres:5432/paideia_db \
  -e S3_URL=http://minio:9000 \
  -e S3_ACCESS_KEY=paideia_minio \
  -e S3_SECRET_KEY=paideia_minio_secret \
  -e S3_ENDPOINT_URL=http://minio:9000 \
  -e S3_BUCKET=paideia \
  -e PAYLOAD_SECRET=your-secret-key-here \
  paideia:latest
```

**Required Environment Variables:**

- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string
- `S3_URL` - MinIO/S3 service URL
- `S3_ACCESS_KEY` - S3 access key
- `S3_SECRET_KEY` - S3 secret key
- `S3_ENDPOINT_URL` - S3 endpoint URL (without bucket name)
- `S3_BUCKET` - S3 bucket name
- `PAYLOAD_SECRET` - Secret key for Payload CMS (generate a strong random string)

**Optional Environment Variables:**

- `PORT` - Backend port (default: 3001)
- `FRONTEND_PORT` - Frontend port (default: 3000)
- `SMTP_HOST` - SMTP server host
- `SMTP_USER` - SMTP username
- `SMTP_PASS` - SMTP password
- `RESEND_API_KEY` - Resend API key for email
- `EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS` - Email sender address (default: info@paideialms.com)
- `EMAIL_FROM_NAME` - Email sender name (default: Paideia LMS)
- `SANDBOX_MODE` - Enable sandbox mode (default: 0)

**Note:** The Docker image includes the Linux ARM64 binary. For production deployments, ensure your Docker host supports ARM64 architecture or build the binary for your target platform.

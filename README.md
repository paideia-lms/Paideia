When setup completes, the application will be available at:  
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000  
- **Backend**: http://localhost:3001


### Option 2: Docker Compose (Full Stack)

Run the complete stack using Docker Compose with pre-built images:

1. **Start all services** (infrastructure + Paideia application):
   ```sh
   docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.paideia.yml up -d
   ```

   This will:
   - Pull the Paideia image from GitHub Container Registry (`ghcr.io/paideia-lms/paideia:latest`)
   - Start PostgreSQL, MinIO, Drizzle Gateway, and Paideia
   - All services configured to work together

2. **Access the application:**
   - **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000
   - **Backend**: http://localhost:3001
   - **MinIO Console**: http://localhost:9001

3. **Stop all services:**
   ```sh
   docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.paideia.yml down
   ```

### Environment Variables

The `.env` file or Docker Compose environment variables should include:

**Required:**
- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string
- `S3_URL` - MinIO/S3 service URL
- `S3_ACCESS_KEY` - S3 access key
- `S3_SECRET_KEY` - S3 secret key
- `S3_ENDPOINT_URL` - S3 endpoint URL (without bucket name)
- `S3_BUCKET` - S3 bucket name
- `PAYLOAD_SECRET` - Secret key for Payload CMS (generate a strong random string)

**Optional:**
- `PORT` - Backend port (default: 3001)
- `FRONTEND_PORT` - Frontend port (default: 3000)
- `SMTP_HOST` - SMTP server host for email
- `SMTP_USER` - SMTP username
- `SMTP_PASS` - SMTP password
- `RESEND_API_KEY` - Resend API key (alternative to SMTP)
- `EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS` - Email sender address (default: info@paideialms.com)
- `EMAIL_FROM_NAME` - Email sender name (default: Paideia LMS)
- `SANDBOX_MODE` - Enable sandbox mode for development/testing (default: 0)

See `server/env.ts` for the complete list of environment variables.

### Sample .env File

Create a `.env` file in the same directory where you run the binary:

```env
# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://paideia:paideia_password@localhost:5432/paideia_db

# S3/MinIO
S3_URL=http://localhost:9000/paideia-bucket
S3_ACCESS_KEY=paideia_minio
S3_SECRET_KEY=paideia_minio_secret
S3_ENDPOINT_URL=http://localhost:9000
S3_BUCKET=paideia-bucket
S3_REGION=us-east-1

# Payload
PAYLOAD_SECRET=paideia_payload_secret

# Ports (optional, defaults shown)
PORT=3001
FRONTEND_PORT=3000

# Email (optional - uncomment if using SMTP)
# SMTP_HOST=smtp.example.com
# SMTP_USER=your-email@example.com
# SMTP_PASS=your-password

# Email (optional - uncomment if using Resend)
# RESEND_API_KEY=your-resend-api-key

# Email sender (optional, defaults shown)
EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=info@paideialms.com
EMAIL_FROM_NAME=Paideia LMS

# Sandbox mode (optional, default: 0)
SANDBOX_MODE=0
```

**Note:** The `.env` file must be in the same directory where you execute the binary. The binary will read environment variables from this file.

## Development

### Docker Compose Setup

The project uses two separate docker compose files to separate infrastructure services from the Paideia application:

- **`docker-compose.yml`**: Contains infrastructure services (PostgreSQL, MinIO, Drizzle Gateway)
- **`docker-compose.paideia.yml`**: Contains the Paideia application service

This separation prevents accidentally starting the Paideia Docker container during development.

### App Only Development

Start only the infrastructure services for development:

```sh
docker compose up -d
```

Or use the dev script which starts infrastructure services and runs the app locally:

```sh
bun dev
```

This starts:
- **PostgreSQL**: localhost:5432 (paideia/paideia_password)
- **MinIO**: http://localhost:9000 (API) / http://localhost:9001 (Web UI)
  - Access Key: paideia_minio
  - Secret Key: paideia_minio_secret
- **Drizzle Gateway**: localhost:4983
  - Master Password: your_master_password
  - Database URL: postgresql://paideia:paideia_password@postgres:5432/paideia_db
- **App** (via `bun dev`): http://localhost:3000

To stop the infrastructure services:

```sh
docker compose down
```

## Production

Build for production:

```sh
bun run build
```

Run in production mode:

```sh
bun start
```

### Releasing

To create a new release and trigger the automated GitHub Actions workflow:

1. **Update the version in `package.json`** to match your desired release version (e.g., `0.5.0`)

2. **Commit and push your changes:**

```sh
git add package.json
git commit -m "chore: bump version to 0.5.0"
git push origin main
```

3. **Create and push a git tag** matching the version with a `v` prefix:

```sh
git tag v0.5.0
git push origin v0.5.0
```

The workflow will automatically:
- Check if a release for this version already exists (to avoid duplicate builds)
- Build macOS ARM64 and Linux ARM64 binaries
- Build and push a Docker image to GitHub Container Registry (`ghcr.io/paideia-lms/paideia`) with tags:
  - `v{VERSION}` (e.g., `v0.5.0`)
  - `latest`
- Create a GitHub release with both binaries attached

You can monitor the workflow progress in the [Actions tab](https://github.com/paideia-lms/paideia/actions) of the repository.

**Note:** The tag name (e.g., `v0.5.0`) must match the version in `package.json` (e.g., `0.5.0`) with a `v` prefix. If a release for that version already exists, the workflow will skip all build steps to save resources.

### Docker

#### Running with Docker Compose

To run the complete Paideia stack (including the Paideia application) with Docker Compose, use both configuration files:

```sh
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.paideia.yml up -d
```

This starts all services:
- Infrastructure services from `docker-compose.yml` (PostgreSQL, MinIO, Drizzle Gateway)
- Paideia application from `docker-compose.paideia.yml`

To stop all services:

```sh
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.paideia.yml down
```

**Note:** During development, use only `docker-compose.yml` to start infrastructure services without the Paideia container. This allows you to run the application locally with `bun dev` for hot-reloading and easier debugging.

#### Building the Linux Binary

The Linux binary must be built in a Linux environment to ensure native dependencies (like `sharp`) are correctly compiled for Linux ARM64. You can use `Dockerfile.build` to create a build environment:

**Option 1: Using Docker Build Environment (Interactive)**

The `Dockerfile.build` creates an interactive build container where you can manually build the Linux binary:

1. **Create and start the build container:**

```sh
bun run docker:build-binary
```

This will:
- Build the Docker image with all dependencies
- Start a container named `paideia-builder`
- Print instructions for entering the container

2. **Enter the container:**

```sh
bun run docker:builder-shell
```

Or manually:
```sh
docker exec -it paideia-builder /bin/bash
```

3. **Build the Linux binary inside the container:**

```sh
bun scripts/build-linux.ts
```

4. **Copy the binary from the container:**

```sh
bun run docker:copy-binary
```

Or manually:
```sh
mkdir -p dist
docker cp paideia-builder:/build/dist/paideia-linux-arm64 ./dist/
```

**Option 2: Using build-linux.ts in a Linux Environment**

If you have access to a Linux machine or Linux container:

```sh
bun run build:linux
```

**Note:** Building the Linux binary on macOS won't work correctly because native dependencies like `sharp` will bundle the macOS version, which won't run on Linux. Always build the Linux binary in a Linux environment.

#### Building the Runtime Docker Image

Once you have the Linux binary in `dist/paideia-linux-arm64`, build the runtime Docker image:

```sh
docker build -t paideia:latest .
```

The runtime image is minimal and only contains the pre-built binary, making it perfect for deployment and GitHub releases.

Run the container with environment variables from a `.env` file:

```sh
docker run -d \
  --name paideia \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -p 3001:3001 \
  --env-file .env \
  paideia:latest
```

Alternatively, you can pass environment variables directly:

```sh
docker run -d \
  --name paideia \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -p 3001:3001 \
  -e DATABASE_URL=postgresql://paideia:paideia_password@postgres:5432/paideia_db \
  -e S3_URL=http://minio:9000 \
  -e S3_ACCESS_KEY=paideia_minio \
  -e S3_SECRET_KEY=paideia_minio_secret \
  -e S3_ENDPOINT_URL=http://minio:9000 \
  -e S3_BUCKET=paideia \
  -e PAYLOAD_SECRET=your-secret-key-here \
  paideia:latest
```

**Required Environment Variables:**

- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string
- `S3_URL` - MinIO/S3 service URL
- `S3_ACCESS_KEY` - S3 access key
- `S3_SECRET_KEY` - S3 secret key
- `S3_ENDPOINT_URL` - S3 endpoint URL (without bucket name)
- `S3_BUCKET` - S3 bucket name
- `PAYLOAD_SECRET` - Secret key for Payload CMS (generate a strong random string)

**Optional Environment Variables:**

- `PORT` - Backend port (default: 3001)
- `FRONTEND_PORT` - Frontend port (default: 3000)
- `SMTP_HOST` - SMTP server host
- `SMTP_USER` - SMTP username
- `SMTP_PASS` - SMTP password
- `RESEND_API_KEY` - Resend API key for email
- `EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS` - Email sender address (default: info@paideialms.com)
- `EMAIL_FROM_NAME` - Email sender name (default: Paideia LMS)
- `SANDBOX_MODE` - Enable sandbox mode (default: 0)

**Note:** The Docker image includes the Linux ARM64 binary. For production deployments, ensure your Docker host supports ARM64 architecture or build the binary for your target platform.

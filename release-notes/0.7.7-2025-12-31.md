## Migration Guide

### Database Migration Required

This release includes a database migration that removes the `status` column from the `activity_modules` table.

**Upgrade Steps**:
1. **Upgrade to v0.7.7**:
   ```bash
   git pull origin next  # or your branch
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

3. **Run database migration**:
   ```bash
   bun run payload migrate
   ```

4. **Regenerate Payload types** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   bun run payload generate:types
   ```

5. **Start the server**:
   ```bash
   bun run dev
   ```

**What Happens During Migration**:
- The `status` column is removed from `activity_modules` table
- The `enum_activity_modules_status` enum type is dropped
- The `status_idx` index is removed
- All existing modules continue to work normally

**After Migration**:
- ✅ All existing modules remain fully functional
- ✅ Module creation and editing forms are simplified
- ✅ Module lists no longer show status badges or columns
- ✅ No data loss - status field was not actively used

- No configuration changes required
- Migration is backward compatible

**Note for Developers**:
- If you have custom code that references the `status` field on activity modules, you'll need to remove those references
- Test files have been updated to remove status from test data
- All internal functions no longer accept or return status values

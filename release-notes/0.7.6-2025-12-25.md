## Bug Fixes

### 🔧 Sandbox Reset Transaction Fix

**Issue**: Sandbox database resets could leave the database in an inconsistent state if the seed operation failed partway through.

**What Was Fixed**:
- **Transaction Consistency**: Seed operations now run within the same transaction as data deletion
- **Atomic Operations**: All sandbox reset operations (deletion + seeding) are now atomic
- **Error Recovery**: If any step fails, the entire operation is rolled back, maintaining database integrity

**User Experience**:
- **For Developers & Testers**:
  - Sandbox resets are now fully reliable and consistent
  - No risk of partial database states after failed resets
  - Automatic rollback ensures database integrity is maintained
  - More reliable testing and development environment

**Technical Details**:
- Fixed missing transaction context in seed operation during sandbox reset
- All database operations now participate in the same transaction
- Ensures atomicity of the entire reset process

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Prevents inconsistent database states
- ✅ Automatic rollback on failure maintains data integrity
- ✅ More reliable sandbox mode for development and testing
- ✅ Better error recovery and system stability

## Summary

This patch release focuses on improving the reliability of sandbox mode, which is essential for development and testing environments. The fix ensures that database resets are fully transactional, preventing any possibility of partial states that could cause issues during development or testing.
